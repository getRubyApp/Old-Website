# Privacy Policy

As a developer, I do not believe in collecting and selling personal user data. Privacy matters to me. That's why we don't collect too much data from Ruby.

## Analytics

To best understand how our users utilize our app, we collect anonymous analytics about the actions taking place in our app. This doesn't involve any personal information. For complete transparency, you can visit our analytics provider [here](https://telemetrydeck.com).

## News Sources

Since Ruby is a News app, we have to source/fetch News articles to show to you. Microsoft is the provider of the News API we use. Additionally, individual publications may keep a tab on you while visiting their websites for advertising purposes. However, this data is not explicitly collected by Ruby, and is instead collected by those running News publications.

## The App

Ruby does not collect any data from the users for running the app. Ruby does however use iCloud (operated by Apple) to sync your user data across devices.
